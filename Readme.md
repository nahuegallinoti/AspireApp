AspireApp
AspireApp is a .NET 9 Blazor application designed with a focus on clean architecture, modularity, and scalability. This README provides an overview of the project's structure, the patterns used, and the key components.
Project Structure
The project is divided into several layers and components, each with a specific responsibility:
•	AspireApp.Api: Contains the API controllers and service configurations.
•	AspireApp.Application: Contains the application logic and service implementations.
•	AspireApp.Core: Contains core utilities, helpers, and common logic.
•	AspireApp.DataAccess: Contains data access implementations and repository patterns.
•	AspireApp.Entities: Contains the entity models.
•	AspireApp.Web.Tests: Contains unit tests for the application.
Key Components and Patterns

1. Authentication and Authorization
JWT authentication is configured to secure the API endpoints.

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddJwtBearer();


2. Caching
The project uses a hybrid caching strategy with Redis and in-memory caching.

builder.Services.AddStackExchangeRedisCache(options =>
{
    options.Configuration = "localhost:6379";
});

builder.Services.AddHybridCache();

3. Entity Framework Core
Entity Framework Core is used for data access. The AppDbContext is configured to use an in-memory database for testing purposes.

builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseInMemoryDatabase("AspireAppDb"));

4. Unit Testing
The project includes comprehensive unit tests using MSTest and Moq for mocking dependencies.
 
5. Base Service Pattern
A base service pattern is used to encapsulate common CRUD operations.

6. Result-Oriented Programming (ROP)
The project uses Result-Oriented Programming (ROP) to handle operation results in a consistent and expressive manner.

7. RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is used for message brokering to facilitate communication between different parts of the system.

builder.Services.AddSingleton<RabbitMqService>(); // Register RabbitMQ service


Getting Started
To run the project, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the repository.
2.	Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.
3.	Restore the NuGet packages.
4.	Build the solution.
5.	Run the project.

Conclusion
AspireApp is a well-structured Blazor application that leverages modern .NET features and best practices. The use of dependency injection, JWT authentication, caching, unit testing, Result-Oriented Programming, and RabbitMQ ensures a robust and maintainable codebase.
